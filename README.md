# Codsoft Task 1

Task 1 :
Mobile App Sign Up flow 

I have created a Twitter Signup / Login page using figma. I have used Android large frame for designing.
The first page of this project contains a request for login into your account. It will ask you whether you would like to login,sign up or create a new account. Then it will go to the corresponding page.
When you click on the login button  it will direct you to the login page and ask you to  enter  the username and password. when you click on the sign up button it will direct you to the to the Sign up page.

I have applied prototype to login, sign up and create account buttons.

I have shared the project link below :
